Building a construction project can be very hard because many different people and tasks are involved. Often, teams use many different tools that do not work well together. 
This can cause confusion, delays, and mistakes. BuildSync was created to solve these problems by bringing everything into one easy-to-use system. With BuildSync, 
all the important information like permits, schedules, and updates are shared with everyone on the team in real time. This means everyone knows what is happening and can 
work together smoothly. BuildSync helps builders save time, avoid costly errors, and finish projects on schedule. It was made to make construction simpler and better for 
everyone involved.
